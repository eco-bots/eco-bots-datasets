Ammonia emissions from agriculture (Tonnes) (EU),Agriculture and food,"The indicator measures the amount of ammonia (NH3) emissions as a result of the agricultural production. This comprises manure management, inorganic N-fertilizers and animal manure applied to soil as well as urine and dung deposited by grazing animals. This definition is in line with the CAP indicator C46. The EU inventory on air pollution compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA) under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) is fully consistent with national air pollution inventories compiled by the EU Member States.",1990,2021,18/09/2023,EEA,Attribution
Ammonia emissions from agriculture (KG_HA) (EU),Agriculture and food,"The indicator measures the amount of ammonia (NH3) emissions as a result of the agricultural production. This comprises manure management, inorganic N-fertilizers and animal manure applied to soil as well as urine and dung deposited by grazing animals. This definition is in line with the CAP indicator C46. The EU inventory on air pollution compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA) under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) is fully consistent with national air pollution inventories compiled by the EU Member States. Ammonia emissions per hectare are calculated using the total utilised agricultural area (UAA) of the relevant year as denominator. Data on the UAA stem from Eurostat’s annual crop statistics.",1990,2021,18/09/2023,EEA,Attribution
Nitrate in groundwater (MG_L) (EU),Agriculture and food,"Indicator refers to concentrations of nitrate (NO3) in groundwater, measured as milligrams per litre (mg NO3/L). Data are taken from well samples and aggregated to annual average values. Nitrate can persist in groundwater for a long time and accumulate at a high level through inputs from anthropogenic sources (mainly agriculture). The EU drinking water standard is limited to 50 mg NO3/L to avoid threats to human health. Only complete series after inter/extrapolation are presented.",2000,2020,19/12/2022,EEA,Attribution
Area under organic farming (PC_UUA) (EU),Agriculture and food,"The indicator measures the share of total utilised agricultural area (UAA) occupied by organic farming (existing organically-farmed areas and areas in process of conversion). Farming is recognised to be organic if it complies with Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, which has set up a comprehensive framework for the organic production of crops and livestock and for the labelling, processing and marketing of organic products, as well as for governing imports of organic products into the EU. The detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008.",2000,2021,27/09/2023,EEA,Attribution
"Government support to agricultural research and development (GBARD) (EU, OECD)",Agriculture and food,"The indicator refers to Government budget allocations for R&D (GBARD) for agriculture. GBARD data measure government support to research and development (R&D) activities, or, in other words, how much priority governments place on the public funding of R&D.

GBARD data are compiled using the guidelines laid out in the OECD’s Frascati Manual from 2015. GBARD data are broken down by socio-economic objectives in accordance to the nomenclature for the analysis and comparison of scientific programmes and budgets (NABS 2007).",2004,2022,03/08/23,Eurostat; OECD,Attribution
