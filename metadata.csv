Ammonia emissions from agriculture (Tonnes) (EU),Agriculture and food,"The indicator measures the amount of ammonia (NH3) emissions as a result of the agricultural production. This comprises manure management, inorganic N-fertilizers and animal manure applied to soil as well as urine and dung deposited by grazing animals. This definition is in line with the CAP indicator C46. The EU inventory on air pollution compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA) under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) is fully consistent with national air pollution inventories compiled by the EU Member States.",1990,2021,18/09/2023,EEA,CC BY 4.0

This definition is in line with the CAP indicator C46. The EU inventory on air pollution compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA) under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) is fully consistent with national air pollution inventories compiled by the EU Member States.

Nitrate in groundwater (MG_L) (EU),Agriculture and food,"Indicator refers to concentrations of nitrate (NO3) in groundwater, measured as milligrams per litre (mg NO3/L). Data are taken from well samples and aggregated to annual average values. Nitrate can persist in groundwater for a long time and accumulate at a high level through inputs from anthropogenic sources (mainly agriculture). The EU drinking water standard is limited to 50 mg NO3/L to avoid threats to human health. Only complete series after inter/extrapolation are presented.",2000,2020,19/12/2022,EEA,CC BY 4.0
Area under organic farming (PC_UUA) (EU),Agriculture and food,"The indicator measures the share of total utilised agricultural area (UAA) occupied by organic farming (existing organically-farmed areas and areas in process of conversion). Farming is recognised to be organic if it complies with Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, which has set up a comprehensive framework for the organic production of crops and livestock and for the labelling, processing and marketing of organic products, as well as for governing imports of organic products into the EU. The detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008.",2000,2021,27/09/2023,EEA,CC BY 4.0
Government support to agricultural research and development (GBARD) (EU),Agriculture and food,"The indicator refers to Government budget allocations for R&D (GBARD) for agriculture. GBARD data measure government support to research and development (R&D) activities, or, in other words, how much priority governments place on the public funding of R&D.

GBARD data are compiled using the guidelines laid out in the OECD’s Frascati Manual from 2015. GBARD data are broken down by socio-economic objectives in accordance to the nomenclature for the analysis and comparison of scientific programmes and budgets (NABS 2007).",2004,2022,03/08/23,Eurostat,CC BY 4.0
Estimated soil erosion by water - area affected by severe erosion rate (KM2) (EU),Agriculture and food,"This indicator estimates the amount of soil lost by water erosion, such as from rain splash, sheet-wash and rills. This provides an indication of the area affected by a certain rate of soil erosion (severe soil loss, E > 10 tonnes/hectare/year). This area is expressed in km2 and as a percentage of the total non-artificial erosive area in the country. Where there is no area of land that is in risk of being subject to soil erosion by water of more than 10 tonnes per hectare, a country will have a zero value. Soil erosion may still be occurring in areas of those countries, but at a rate of less than 10 tonnes per hectare. These numbers are estimated from soil-erosion susceptibility models and should not be taken as measured values. Where there is no area of land that shows a risk of soil erosion by water of more than 10 tonnes per hectare, a country will have a zero value. Risk of soil erosion may still be present in areas of those countries, but at a rate of less than 10 tonnes per hectare.",2000,2016,08/02/21,JRC,CC BY 4.0

Net greenhouse gas emissions (T_HAB) (EU),Air pollution,"The indicator measures total national emissions (from both ESD and ETS sectors) including international aviation of the so called ‘Kyoto basket’ of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the so-called F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, nitrogen triflouride (NF3) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)) from all sectors of the GHG emission inventories (including international aviation and indirect CO2). The indicator is presented in two forms: as net emissions including land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) as well as excluding LULUCF.

Average CO2 emissions per km from new passenger cars (EU),Air pollution,"The indicator is defined as the average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per km by new passenger cars in a given year. The reported emissions are based on type-approval and can deviate from the actual CO2 emissions of new cars. Since 2021, the emissions are measured with a new test procedure (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure WLTP), compared to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) procedure used until 2020. The WLTP aims to reflect better real driving conditions and WLTP values are systematically higher than NEDC values.

Global mean surface seawater acidity,Water pollution,"The indicator shows the global ocean surface acidity expressed as mean pH value. The decline in pH observed on a global scale corresponds to an increase in the acidity of ocean water and vice versa. An increase of atmospheric CO2 enhances the absorption of CO2 by oceans, which correlates directly with a fall in pH values of the oceans. The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) provides annual data on mean ocean surface acidity using in situ data and remote sensing data, as well as empirical relationships.",2002,2021,01/03/23,CMEMS,CC BY 4.0
Marine waters affected by eutrophication (KM2) (EU),Water pollution,"The indicator shows the share of eutrophic marine waters in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). An area is classified as eutrophic if for more than 25 % of the observation days of a given year the chlorophyll concentrations as a proxy for eutrophication are above the 90th percentile of the 1998–2017 reference base line. Eutrophication is the process by which an excess of nutrients – mainly phosphorus and nitrogen – leads to increased growth of plant material, particularly algal blooms, in an aquatic body resulting in a decrease in water quality. This can, in turn, cause death by hypoxia of aquatic organisms. Anthropogenic activities, such as farming, agriculture, aquaculture, industry and sewage, are the main source of nutrient input in problem areas. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires Member States to report on eutrophication for their regional seas every 6 years. The Copernicus Marine Service has calculated the indicator from satellite imagery.",2000,2022,13/03/2023,CMEMS,CC BY 4.0

Share of forest area (PC) (EU),Conservation,"The indicator measures the proportion of forest ecosystems in comparison to the total area. Data used for this indicator is derived from the Land Use and Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS). The LUCAS land use and land cover classification has been adapted to FAO forest definitions, distinguishing between the categories 'forests' and 'other wooded land'. LUCAS surveys are carried out in-situ, this means that observations are made and registered on the ground by field surveyors. A mixed panel approach is used, so some points are visited in subsequent years. In the field, the surveyor classifies the land cover and the visible land use according to the harmonized LUCAS Survey land cover and land use classifications.",2009,2018,18/05/2021,Eurostat,CC BY 4.0
